<p class="text-center">What type of job positions am I looking for?</p>
<br>
<p class="text-center">I am interested in working as a Data Analyst. I've recently been manipulating data and visualizing it using R in RStudio. Last semester, I was offered to work along side with ones of my professors
in an experimental study. I was being put head of the study to calibrate and record data from all 150 participants. The experiment consisted of using vision sensors in where data was going to
be obtained and saved. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 crisis, the experiment was not able to be conducted, though I worked with data from a previous experiment my professor had previously
had worked on my own time. This was an independent study course in which I had dedicated to work on six hours a week. </p>

    <p class="text-center">I am interested in working as a Software Developer using languages such as Java and Python. I have created a calculator interface and a florist shop app using JavaFX. I find it very interesting
    how code can manipulate and create such wonderful utilities for individuals to easily use. </p>

    <p class="text-center">I also have experience with Adobe Illustrator, PhotoShop and Animate. I have utilized these software to create a variety of unique characters for different games with different themes.
        Furthermore, I have created a 2D and 3D graphics game on Unity. </p>
